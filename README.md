# simplegraphlib
Simple c++ library for graph manipulation, parallelized with OpenMP.

This library provides a simple implementation of a templated graph object, with methods, operators, functionnal operators to work with graphs, and a few classic algorithms, such as width-first and depth-first search, path detection or cycle and connected components detection.
